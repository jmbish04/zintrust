# Deployment

Deploying a Zintrust application is straightforward thanks to its zero-dependency core and standard Node.js architecture.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher.
- A supported database (SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL).

## Build Process

First, compile your TypeScript code to JavaScript:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the production-ready files in the `dist/` directory.

## Environment Configuration

Ensure your `.env` file is properly configured for production:

```env
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=your-db-host
```

## Running the Server

You can start the server using the Zintrust CLI (provided by `@zintrust/core`):

```bash
npm start
```

Or directly using `node` (after building):

```bash
node dist/src/index.js
```

For production, it's recommended to use a process manager like **PM2**:

```bash
pm2 start dist/src/index.js --name zintrust-app
```

## Migrations

Run your migrations on the production database:

```bash
zin migrate --force
```

## Bundle Optimization

For cloud deployments (AWS Lambda, Cloudflare Workers), bundle size is critical. Zintrust includes a built-in **Bundle Optimizer** to reduce your deployment artifact size.

The optimizer performs:

- **Tree-shaking**: Removes unused code and dependencies.
- **Platform-specific pruning**: Removes adapters not needed for the target platform (e.g., removing SQL drivers for Cloudflare).
- **Minification**: Compresses JavaScript files.

To run the optimizer:

```bash
# Optimize for AWS Lambda
npm run build:lambda

# Optimize for Cloudflare Workers
npm run build:cloudflare
```

You can also run the optimizer manually:

```bash
# Analyze current bundle
npx tsx src/builder/BundleOptimizer.ts analyze

# Optimize for specific platform
npx tsx src/builder/BundleOptimizer.ts lambda
```

## Static Assets

If your application serves static assets, it's recommended to use a reverse proxy like **Nginx** to serve them directly for better performance.
